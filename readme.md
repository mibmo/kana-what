<h2 id="what-is-srs">What is SRS? ˗ˏˋ★ˎˊ˗</h2>
SRS, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition#Software"><strong>S</strong>paced <strong>R</strong>epetition <strong>S</strong>oftware</a>,
is software designed to help memorize and learn topics through the use of <i>spaced repetition</i> — a technique where new flashcards are introduced to the learner slowly, and old flashcards are reintroduced with a frequency/spacing dependent on how well the flashcard has been remembered.

A comprehensive explanation is available at the [wikipedia page for Spaced Repetition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition), which also details the psyochological spacing effect upon which the technique is based.
This SRS is built upon the [Free Spaced Repetition Scheduler (FSRS)](https://github.com/open-spaced-repetition/free-spaced-repetition-scheduler).
